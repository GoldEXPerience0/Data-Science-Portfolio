# Project 1: Visualizing CDC Behavioral Health Data via Geo-spatial Plot  

* Merged a CDC dataset on behavioral health and a health policy dataset for the number of relevant policies passed

* Designed a dragging bar to change the map year by year

* Designed a dependent drop-down menu to select a health topic and subsequently a question of inquiry 

* Display state-specific data while a cursor is hovering over a state 

* Added color bar better compare states per question of inquiry
