									<h1>Z-score</h1>
									<p>How are you relative to everyone else?</p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/zscore.png" alt="" /></div>
								<h2>What is a Z-score?</h2>
								<h3>Test Score Example</h3>
								<p>Without a formal definition, it tells you how you are relative to everyone else. Let's begin with an example. Say you are in a class of 10 students and took a biology test. 
								These were the scores: 86, 92, 81, 86, 87, 94, 97, 85, 93, 88.
								Let's say you got the 92. That is a pretty good score. But how do we tell how well you did from everyone else? The values given outright are called the raw values. 
								Think of these, original numbers, or raw numbers, as a perspective of how you can see the numbers. What if I told you, we could see it another way? Here come the z-scores. We do need to know two other pieces of information:
								the mean and the standard deviation.</p>
								<h3>Calculating Components of Z-Score</h3>
								<p>First is the mean, or \(\mu\), and the other is the standard deviation, or \(\sigma\), of the population, i.e., in this situation is the classroom. 
								Adding the scores and dividing them by the number of students will get you the mean: (86+92+81+86+87+94+97+85+93+88)/10 = 88.9. With this information alone we understand that you did better than the average.
								Maybe this would suffice, but let's get a little more detailed. Let's find out the standard deviation, or the spread of the numbers. 
								This will require taking the square root of the average squared difference between the raw value and the mean: \(\sigma = \sqrt{\frac{\Sigma^{N}_{i=1}(x_i - \mu)^2}{N}}\). Since we know that there are 10 students, N = 10.
								This means we will have the summation of 10 values at the top of the fraction from 1 to 10. 
								\(x_i\) simply means any individual score of a student which is the raw score because it has yet to be converted into the new perspective of z-scores. \(x_1\) = 86 and \(x_2\) = 92 and so on until \(x_{10}\), which is 88.
								For the first difference squared that is \(x_1\), it is \((x_1-\mu)^2=(86-88.9)^2=8.41\). The total set of ten after the operation is 8.41, 9.61, 62.41, 8.41, 3.61, 26.01, 65.61, 15.21, 16.81,
								0.81. Taking the average of that is summing them and dividing by 10 or approximately 21.69. Then the square root of that number will be about 4.66 for the standard deviation.
								</p>
								<h3>Calculating Your Z-score</h3>
								<p>We have \(\mu=88.9\) and \(\sigma=4.66\), so we can use the z-score equation:  \(z = \frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}\). The \(x\) is any raw value that can be converted to a z-score, so our original scores.
								Now for the moment of truth for your score: \(z = \frac{92-88.9}{4.66}\) which is about 0.67. But, what does this mean? First, we look at the sign. We see that it is positive.
								Since the sign is positive you are above the mean of the class. If it was negative, you would be below the class mean. Next, the value, 0.67. Notice that the equation is divided by the standard deviation.
								This means we are based in units of standard deviation. If we have a z-score of 1, we are 1 standard deviation away from the mean in the positive direction, i.e., above the mean. We can have fractions of a standard deviation.
								This is the case. We have 0.67 of a standard deviation above the mean. For all the z-scores they can be calculated (and rounded) to be the following: -0.62,  0.67, -1.70, -0.62, -0.41,
								1.10, 1.74, -0.84, 0.88, -0.19.    
								</p>
								<h3>Comparing Raw Values to Z-score Values</h3>
								<p>To elucidate the relationship, let's sort both the raw test scores and the z-scored version of the test scores in ascending order to compare. The raw values are 81, 85, 86, 86, 87, 88, 92, 93, 94, 97.
									And the z-score values respectively are -1.70, -0.84, -0.62, -0.62, -0.41, -0.19, 0.67, 0.88, 1.10, 1.74. We now see that with the z-scores, unlike the raw scores go from negative numbers to 0 to positive numbers. 
									Remember with z-scores, the mean of the set has a z-score of 0: \(z = \frac{x-\mu}{\sigma} = \frac{\mu-\mu}{\sigma} = 0\).
									This is significant because now we gain information of directionality relative to the mean, positive or negative, and by how much with its magnitude. 
									We see that the larger the negative number, the further to the left the number can be from the mean, so it is increasing smaller: -0.41 is to 87 as -1.70 is to 81.
									On the contrary, the larger the positive number, the further to the right the number can be from the mean, so it is increasing larger: 0.67 is to 92 as 1.74 is to 97.
									We can plot the histograms of both sets of numbers below with their mean in orange to see the distributions.
								</p>

								<h3>Comparison of Uses: Raw vs Z-score</h3>
								<p>We see from the figure that the distributions are the same with only the numbers associated with them changed. Again, it is perspective. The major difference is that with z-scores we gained some intrinsic information of all the scores baked into the value.
								Going back to the beginning, if we said you had a score of 92. You may have the best score, the worst score, or average score. We do not know. If we told you, you had a z-score of 0.67,
								you now know you did better than the average by some. Okay, but let's argue further. 
								Why not just argue that I just need my score and the average score? 92 and 88.9 are the numbers, so you know that you did better than the average just like the z-score.
								However, you would be missing the standard deviation piece of the information. We know you did better than the average, but we do not know how everyone else did in the distribution.
								Maybe there was a wide spread of scores. If so, that means there can be many people who did better and worse compared to you. On the other hand, with a smaller spread, this would mean that everyone had similar scores to you.
								With a z-score, we actually standardized or normalized the spread, so this is a more reliable comparison to know where you are within the distribution of scores. 
								This is if your distribution is normal, you can apply the 68-95-99.7 rule, or look up the area under the curve to find the relative percentile you are from all the other scores.
								Interpreting further requires knowing if the distribution is normal or not. 
								</p>

								<!-- <h3>Aside: Testing for Normality</h3>
								<p>In addition to using a histogram to have a visual check for normality, we have the Q-Q plot as another graphical way as well as other normality tests.
								A Q-Q plot is a scatter plot with the sample quantiles plotted against the normal theoretical quantiles. Quantiles are values that divide the data into equally sized groups.
								If you divide your data points into 100 equal size groups, the quantile is then a percentile. If it is 10 equally sized groups, it is a decile. If it 4 equally sized groups, it is a quartile.
								For example, in quartiles, the first quartile is with 25% of the values underneath it, the second with 50% of the values underneath it, the 3rd with 75%, then the fourth has 100% or all the values.
								In a quartile, the 50% is also called median.  -->
								
								<!-- On quantiles: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02I84i8Knas -->

								<!-- Since we have 10 values,    
								if the 50% quantile, which is also the median, divides the data into two groups with 50% of the data points below it. If there were 10 data points,
								the 50% quantile would have 5 data points below it or 5 test scores. The 25% quantile would have 25% of the points below this line. Since we cannot have part of a data point, we round down,
								so there are 2 data points in a set of 10 numbers.  -->

								</p>

								<h3>Implications of Normal vs Non-Normal Distribution</h3>
								<p>When we know that the values fall under a normal distribution, we know that 68% percent of the values fall within 1 standard deviation away from the mean.
								That means on each side is 68%/2 or 34%. So a z-score of 1, would be 34% beyond the middle point which is 50% or 84%, meaning z=1 would mean it contains 84% of all the scores below it.
								With a z-score of 0.67, it is not so clean cut, and we should use a z-table. We can search online for a z-table, find a z-table with the positive values because we have a positive z-score in our case,
								and scan down the left most column to find the tenths place of the z-score: 0.6. Then we scan across the top of the table along the columns to find the hundreths place: 0.07.
								The intersection will find the value: 0.7486 or 74.86% of all the values in our set are below our value.
								</p>
								<p>What if we find out that our distribution is not normal? How would we interpret these z-scores?
								It can be used to get a rough idea, but note that we would not be able to use the z-table to connect it to a percentile. 
								Instead we can use Chebyshev's theorem to find the minimum proportion of data within k standard deviations of the mean: \(1-\frac{1}{k^2}\) with k>1.
								This can be used on any distribution, so not just non-normal distributions.
								So if within 2 standard deviations from the mean, the math simplifies as follows: \(1-\frac{1}{k^2} = 1-\frac{1}{2^2} = 1-\frac{1}{4} =0.75 \). 
								For 3 standard deviations from the mean we have the following: \(1-\frac{1}{k^2} = 1-\frac{1}{3^2} = 1-\frac{1}{9} = 0.8889 \). This means within 2 standard deviations from the mean,
								there should be at least 75% of the data or scores, and for 3 standard deviations it would be at least 88.89% of the scores (approximately).
								So with 0.67, it may not be so useful but we know that we are less than 2 standard deviations so we can say it does not contain at least 75%. 
								In other words we contain less than 75% of the scores with our raw value of 92.
								</p>

								<h3>Summary</h3>
								<p>Z-scores is another perspective on a value within a set of values. It has directionality and magnitude of its value relative to the mean.
								Moreover, it gives an approximate (or more exact with normally distributed numbers) idea of how many values are below or above it relative to all the values.
								Using a raw value gives you a piece of information, but using a z-score gives you the larger picture. 
								Note that z-scores are so versatile and can be used in medical implications such as bone density, height, and blood pressure.

								<!-- <p>Sure. We know we have a fraction of a standard deviation above the mean. But how good is that? This is where knowing now much a standard deviation covers within a normal distribution.
								The values within 1 standard deviation from the mean, meaning the area above and below the mean, contains 68% of the population of all the scores. Values within 2 standard deviations is 95%. And 3 standard deviations is 99.7%. 
								This is the 68-95-99.7 rule. This means as we increase in standard deviations from 0 to 1 to 2 to 3, we are increasingly moving away from the mean 
								and approaching more extreme values--high if positive or low if negative. If we had a z-score of 1, we know that we are 68%/2=34% above the mean. With a z-score of 0.67 which is less than 1, we are within 34% above the mean but less far away than 34% of the values.
								</p>

								<p>
									To make more sense, let's reorder the values in ascending order and calculate their z-scores. 81, 85, 86, 86, 87, 88, 92, 93, 94, 97.  So if we have a z-score of 1, we know that 68% of the scores are above and below the mean of 88.9, and since 1 (not -1) is in the positive direction we have 68%/2 = 34% in position above the mean.

								<h2>What are the assumptions?</h2> -->


								<!-- <p>Z-score is a number that signifies how far a raw number is from the mean by a number of standard deviations. Wait, what do you mean by a raw number?
								Raw numbers are just the values that you originally have to analyze like scores on a test, but they become z-scores after a mathematical transformation.
								It is also important to note that this transformation is valid if the distribution of the raw values takes on the form of a <a href='NormalDist_Post.html'><em>normal distribution</em></a>.
								After the transformation, they are essentially "cooked" and ready to be "served," i.e., interpreted. Let's say the mean score is 70 out of 100 with a standard deviation of 20,
								and we have other scores like 50 and 95. The equation from the featured image is used, the mean would then be transformed to 0 because it is at the mean; 
								lower values than the mean would be negative with 50 becoming -1; and, higher values than the mean would be positive with 95 becoming +1.25. 
								</p>

								<p>
								In the illustration above, the bell curves have vertical dashed lines with the center being the mean and others to the left and right in increments of 1 standard deviation--with 3 on the left and 3 on the right.
								The values labeled on the top are the raw values of the scores, and the bottom we have -1 standard deviation and +1 standard deviation to the left and right respectively. The standard deviations continue as 
								-2 and -3 on the left and +2 and +3 on the right, but are left out to not crowd the graph.
								I have labeled the raw values in black that transform into the z-scores shown in blue. The vertical line in blue shows its final calculated location showing its relative position.
								</p>
								<p>
								By using a Z-score, it becomes easier to compare where any particular raw number is in comparison to the rest of the numbers because it is based on a common reference point: the mean. 
								We know the direction the relative value is by the sign of the z-score, and we know roughly how far the value is from the mean by the magnitude of the number. Moreover, knowing where a value relative to others 
								can be done by percentile because the area under the distribution sums up to 1, meaning parts of the curve are essentially fractions of 100, and a raw value can be 0.75, the 75 percentile, being 
								a value 75% above all other values in relation to the set of values. More of this will be clarified with worked out examples below.  
								</p>
								<h2>What is a Z-table?</h2>
								<p>However, before more calculations, it is best to know your tools. One of them is the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=z+table&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjDvLfm65z7AhV1FlkFHWAeD3sQ_AUoAXoECAMQAw&biw=1280&bih=609&dpr=1.5"><em>Z-table</em></a> also known as the <em>standard normal table</em>.
								This can actually be shown as two tables, but the idea is that the z-score corresponds to the cumulative amount of area it covers from the left most end of the normal distribution towards the right to its exact z-score. One table shows z-scores that are negative, so the z-scores are to the left of the mean. Inversely, 
								the other table shows positive z-scores that are to the right of the mean. The rows on the left of the table are one's and tenth's digit of the z-score,
								and the columns above show the hundreth's digit of the z-score. The intersection of the row and column is just the score added together. For example, if one had a z-score of -2.35, the row would be -2.3 and the column would be 0.05, so the combination would be -2.35.
								With that in mind, the intersection is the area that is covered from the far left of the distribution to that exact z-score. Because the total area of the population sums to 1, this area corresponds to the probability of having those range of values, or the percentile score.
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/ztable_probpercent.png" alt="" /></div>
								</p>
								
								<h2>Full Example with Questions</h2>
								<p>Assume we had a class of 35 students who received the following grade scores: [84, 73, 70, 55, 67, 67, 69, 64, 69, 66, 59, 77, 77, 83, 70, 66, 65, 57, 77, 61, 60, 68, 81, 71, 61, 64, 75, 68, 63, 68, 75, 85, 60, 64, 63].</p>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/classhist.png" alt="" /></div>				
								<p>We can ask what is the probability (the decimal form) of raw values below, above, or between values. We can also ask what the percentile score is for a value.
								The example questions we are going to ask include the following:
								(1) What is the probability of a score being below 60?
								(2) What is the probability of a score being above 80?
								(3) What is the probability having a score between 70 and 85?
								It also important to note an assumption: Since we have >30 instances and we consider this class as the complete population, we approximate the normal distribution and use the z-score and z-table.
								</p>
								<h3>Preparation work</h3>
								<p>We need to calculate some values: (1) the mean, (2) the standard deviation.</p>
								<h3>What is the probability of a score being below 60?</h3>
								<p>1) We need to find the area from the left tail all the way to the score with 70.</p>
								<h3>What is the probability of a score being above 80?</h3>
								<h3>What is the probability having a score between 70 and 85?</h3>
