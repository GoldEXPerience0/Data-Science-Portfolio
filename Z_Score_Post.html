								<h2>What is a Z-score?</h2>
								<p>Z-score is a number that signifies how far a raw number is from the mean by a number of standard deviations. Wait, what do you mean by a raw number?
								Raw numbers are just the values that you originally have to analyze like scores on a test, but they become z-scores after a mathematical transformation.
								It is also important to note that this transformation is valid if the distribution of the raw values takes on the form of a <a href='NormalDist_Post.html'><em>normal distribution</em></a>.
								After the transformation, they are essentially "cooked" and ready to be "served," i.e., interpreted. Let's say the mean score is 70 out of 100 with a standard deviation of 20,
								and we have other scores like 50 and 95. The equation from the featured image is used, the mean would then be transformed to 0 because it is at the mean; 
								lower values than the mean would be negative with 50 becoming -1; and, higher values than the mean would be positive with 95 becoming +1.25. 
								</p>

								<p>
								In the illustration above, the bell curves have vertical dashed lines with the center being the mean and others to the left and right in increments of 1 standard deviation--with 3 on the left and 3 on the right.
								The values labeled on the top are the raw values of the scores, and the bottom we have -1 standard deviation and +1 standard deviation to the left and right respectively. The standard deviations continue as 
								-2 and -3 on the left and +2 and +3 on the right, but are left out to not crowd the graph.
								I have labeled the raw values in black that transform into the z-scores shown in blue. The vertical line in blue shows its final calculated location showing its relative position.
								</p>
								<p>
								By using a Z-score, it becomes easier to compare where any particular raw number is in comparison to the rest of the numbers because it is based on a common reference point: the mean. 
								We know the direction the relative value is by the sign of the z-score, and we know roughly how far the value is from the mean by the magnitude of the number. Moreover, knowing where a value relative to others 
								can be done by percentile because the area under the distribution sums up to 1, meaning parts of the curve are essentially fractions of 100, and a raw value can be 0.75, the 75 percentile, being 
								a value 75% above all other values in relation to the set of values. More of this will be clarified with worked out examples below.  
								</p>
								<h2>What is a Z-table?</h2>
								<p>However, before more calculations, it is best to know your tools. One of them is the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=z+table&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjDvLfm65z7AhV1FlkFHWAeD3sQ_AUoAXoECAMQAw&biw=1280&bih=609&dpr=1.5"><em>Z-table</em></a> also known as the <em>standard normal table</em>.
								This can actually be shown as two tables, but the idea is that the z-score corresponds to the cumulative amount of area it covers from the left most end of the normal distribution towards the right to its exact z-score. One table shows z-scores that are negative, so the z-scores are to the left of the mean. Inversely, 
								the other table shows positive z-scores that are to the right of the mean. The rows on the left of the table are one's and tenth's digit of the z-score,
								and the columns above show the hundreth's digit of the z-score. The intersection of the row and column is just the score added together. For example, if one had a z-score of -2.35, the row would be -2.3 and the column would be 0.05, so the combination would be -2.35.
								With that in mind, the intersection is the area that is covered from the far left of the distribution to that exact z-score. Because the total area of the population sums to 1, this area corresponds to the probability of having those range of values, or the percentile score.

								<h2>Full Example with Questions</h2>
								<p>Assume we had a class of 30 students who received the following grade scores: [68,76,84,61,71,73,73,63,61,60,89,58,52,66,75,65,67,72,68,57,74,78,55,58,64,59,67,84,66,68].</p>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/classhist.png" alt="" /></div>				
								<p>We can ask what is the probability (the decimal form) or percentile score (percent form) of raw values below, above, or between values.</p>
								
								<h2>How to use Z-score for outlier detection?</h2>
								<p></p>
								<h2>Z-score vs Z-statistic</h2>
								<p></p>
								<h2>Z-score vs T-score?</h2>
								<p>Z-scores are used for normal distributions, where you know the population standard deviation and there are at least 30 samples.</p>
